Intel SS4200 Tools
------------------

Currently, the job of the tools is to set the HDD LEDs depending on the drives
status (standby, running, defect).

If a drive has a defect, the flashing amber LED has priority over the normal
status.

Monitor if a drive is running or sleeping and set the LED to green or off.


> smart_leds
------------

Monitor S.M.A.R.T. status 197 and 198 and set LEDs to flashing amber on error.

197 - Current_Pending_Sector
198 - Offline_Uncorrectable
